Continuous Potentiometer:
Bourns Inc. 6639S-1-103
datasheet: http://www.bourns.com/docs/Product-Datasheets/6539.pdf

Basically, the microcontroller will sample the impedance of the potentiometer,
which spins freely around.
The values need to be calibrated in the main code so that the wind direction can be determined.
