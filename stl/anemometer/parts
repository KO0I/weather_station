Bearings type: two of unknown size
Main shaft:    unknown threaded rod length
               needs 4-6 nuts of the same type

US1881 Hall Effect sensor
10kOhm Resistor
Capacitor (value unknown)

circuit diagram in circuit.png. Cap likely is between 5V and ground to clean
things up

Hall latches when exposed to a changing magnetic field. I'm not sure how
sensitive the sensor is; the rod probably needs to be magnetized for the
sensor to work. It is also possible the rod needs to be modified to work.
