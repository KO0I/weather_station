A collection of weather-station stls that I want to put together as part of an
amateur weather station.

Objectives:
- wireless
- lightweight
- waterproof
- winterproof?
- easy to replicate

To be controlled by an ESP8266 or other microcontroller.

Currently intended to track:
Wind speed      (simple pulses)
Rainfall        (simple pulses)
Wind direction  (potentiometer)
Temperature     (SHT15 w/ quasi-I2C)
Humidity        (SHT15 w/ quasi-I2C)

Interested in adding in:

Lightning detection (antenna and circuit)
Sunlight exposure sensors (measure power from a few small solar panel nodes?)
RTLSDR housing+weatherproofing
